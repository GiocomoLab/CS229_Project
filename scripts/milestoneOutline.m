% To do
% Make plots of features we're using and examples of grid vs non-grid vs
% border - Malcolm



% Run SVM and logistic regression with L2 penalty 

% learning curve to see if we're overfitting 

% try nonlinear kernel on SVM (rbf) 

% show that all of the predictive power comes from the fourier transform

% leads us to believe that we should try some other transforms or a
% convolutional layer to pick out location invariant spatial features

% need to add additional features to classifier like time series
% autocorrelation, spike-triggered autocorrelation,
% time warping each trials time series


% try testing with uneven classes
